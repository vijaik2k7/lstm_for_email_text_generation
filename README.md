# LSTMs and Email Generation
A tutorial that I had put together for explaining LSTMs and their advantages compared to RNNs and presented recently
The objective of the tutorial was to come out with an understanding of:

1. What are RNNs and what are the applications of RNNs?
2. Why choose LSTMs over RNNS?
3. Where to apply LSTMs?

The presentation is followed by a code walkthrough of using LSTMs for a Email Generation use case where a sequence to sequence LSTM model is used. The model is trained on text from conversations (email) and generate. 

Note: This is a skeletal repository of my work and does not contain data that was originally used for the model due to privacy reasons.
